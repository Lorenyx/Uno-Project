extends player class to have a "name" and a deck
Can do something with looking at the given cards in deck(Card array), give them points for how valid of a card it could be and send to card with the most/highest points to the discard deck. Up for interpretation on how to give out points to a card.
methods:
assignPointsToDeck(Card[] deck, Card cardOnTopOfDiscardStack)-look at the 			top card of discard deck and compare it each card in Players deck and assign it 			points given how choice of a choice to play it is. 
use Player.removeCard(deck, cardIndex) to remove a card, put in on top of 			discard deck, and return new deck
TODO figure out how I make an AI difficulty and what to change about the AIâ€™s decisions given what difficulty is applied
